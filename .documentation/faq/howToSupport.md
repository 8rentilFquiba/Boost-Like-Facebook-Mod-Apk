How can I support CanvasBlocker?
------
The best way to support CanvasBlocker is to give feedback. If something is not working like it should or something could be improved please open an [issue](https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker/issues/new). Reviews at [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/reviews/) can also help to increase the user base but it is a very bad platform to communicate issues and improvements.

If you want to contribute with your own spare time you can help to improve the [translations](https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker/issues/420). Code contributions can also be done in form of pull requests but will be reviewed very thoroughly.

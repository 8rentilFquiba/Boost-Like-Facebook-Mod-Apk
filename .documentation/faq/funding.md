How is CanvasBlocker funded?
-------
There is no steady monetary funding of CanvasBlocker. Donations are accepted and help to cover some expenses. But since these are not that high it is not sure if a steady funding with any obligations will be accepted.

There is also no plan to monetize CanvasBlocker in any way.

All the development work is done by kkapsner in their spare time and no salary or compensation is paid for it.

So it's all done voluntarily for fun and free.
